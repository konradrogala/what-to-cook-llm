# What-to-Cook LLM Project Analysis

## Current Implementation

### âœ… Core Features
1. Recipe Generation
   - Integration with OpenAI API
   - Support for both string and array input formats
   - Structured recipe output (title, ingredients, instructions)
   - Basic metadata (cooking time, servings, difficulty)

2. API Design
   - RESTful architecture
   - JSON request/response format
   - Clear endpoint structure
   - Proper HTTP status codes

3. Error Handling
   - Comprehensive error catching
   - Descriptive error messages
   - Proper error categorization
   - OpenAI API error handling

4. Rate Limiting
   - Session-based tracking
   - 5 requests per hour limit
   - Reset time information
   - Remaining requests counter

5. Testing
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Test coverage for error scenarios
   - Mocked external services
