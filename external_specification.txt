You need to create a web application that generates a step-by-step recipe for a dish
based on the provided ingredients. The recipe should be generated using an LLM, so a
cookbook is not necessary :)
This task should be implemented using Ruby; however, you are not required to use Rails.
You are free to choose the tools you prefer. We will evaluate your code based on its
readability and ease of maintenance. We want to see code that reveals its intent to the
reader and follows the best practices.
You need to ensure that the code works and use any tools or techniques to accomplish
this. We are expecting to see a couple of unit tests covering your code as well.
Specifications:
● Create a page where user can input ingredients
● Back-end receives the ingredients and query LLM to generate a recipe based on
them (there are free APIs that you can use https://www.anthropic.com/ or
https://groq.com/)
● The recipe should be displayed on the page where you entered the ingredients.
Implementation requirements:
● The front-end should only communicate with the back-end using APIs. You can
choose whatever is good for you, Native JS, jQuery, React, Vue, etc.
● The back-end should be Ruby but not necessarily Rails
● Tests are required
Nice to have but not required:
Validate the output from the LLM to confirm that the text it returned is indeed a recipe.
